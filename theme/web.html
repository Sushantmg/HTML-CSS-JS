      <p class="Info">
        I'm a Software Engineering student with a passion for coding every day.
        I actively use GitHub and I'm currently learning the MERN stack. My
        interests also include AI, machine learning, and robotics, with a goal
        of working in space tech. Academically, I have always been a dedicated
        and high-achieving student. I secured excellent grades in both SEE and
        +2, excelling in subjects like mathematics and computer science, which
        further fueled my passion for technology. My ability to grasp complex
        concepts and apply them practically has set me apart throughout my
        academic journey. At university, I actively participate in coding
        competitions, hackathons, and technical seminars to enhance my
        problem-solving and software development skills.
      </p>
      <p class="Info">From a young age, I have been captivated by technology and innovation. I thrive on solving complex problems
        through code and have a deep passion for software development. My expertise lies in front-end technologies 
        like HTML and CSS, and I am currently mastering the MERN stack at Skill Shikshya to build full-fledged web applications.
       </p>
    <p class="Info">Beyond coding, I am a sports enthusiast, with basketball, football, and swimming being my go-to activities. 
        The thrill of competition and teamwork in sports translates into my approach to programmingâ€”where strategy, 
        persistence, and adaptability are key.</p>
    
    <p class="Info">What sets me apart is my relentless curiosity and vision for the future.
        I am particularly drawn to artificial intelligence and robotics, with a strong desire to contribute to
         cutting-edge innovations. One of my dreams is to leverage my AI knowledge to work with space organizations and 
         push the boundaries of technology beyond Earth.</p>
